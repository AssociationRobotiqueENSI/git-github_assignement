Welcome to the **Git & GitHub Assignment Repository**! 

This repository is created to help you practice and solidify the concepts you’ve learned in the Git & GitHub workshop.  

## Objective  
The goal of this assignment is to give you hands-on experience with:  
- Version control using Git.  
- Collaboration on GitHub.  
- Working with branches and pull requests.  

## Steps to Complete the Assignment  
1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.  
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.  
3. Create a new branch named `feature-<your-name>`.  
4. Add a new directory with your name and inside it:  
   - Create a file `<your-name>_note.txt` to write about your learnings.  
   - Create a file `<your-name>-first-branch.txt` to explain how branching helps in collaboration.  
5. Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message.  
6. Push your branch to your forked repository.  
7. Create a Pull Request (PR) to the original repository.  

## Hoping for Your Best!
