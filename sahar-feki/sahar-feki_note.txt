In this workshop, I learned about Git and GitHub. Git is a distributed version control system that helps track changes in code and collaborate effectively on projects. It allows developers to create branches for experimenting, merge changes seamlessly, and revert to previous versions if needed. GitHub, on the other hand, is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories, enabling collaboration through features like pull requests, issue tracking, and code reviews. Together, Git and GitHub provide a powerful workflow for managing and sharing code in individual and team projects.
