Branching in Git allows team members to work independently on features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase. This approach ensures that changes can be developed and tested in isolation before being merged. It promotes collaboration by allowing multiple developers to contribute simultaneously, streamlining the development process and reducing conflicts.
