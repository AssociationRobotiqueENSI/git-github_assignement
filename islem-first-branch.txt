Branching is an essential feature in version control systems like Git. 
It allows developers to work on separate tasks or features in isolation 
without affecting the main codebase. This ability to create different branches 
facilitates collaboration and enables efficient parallel development. 
By creating a branch for each new feature or bug fix, developers can 
collaborate without interfering with each other's work. Once changes are 
ready, they can be merged back into the main branch after thorough review.
